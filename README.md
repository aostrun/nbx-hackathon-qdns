# QDNS - Q Name Service

> Project developed during the NBX Hackathon

Q Name Service (QNS) is inspired by the ENS project, but with full integration of Q's governance. Main goal of QNS is to improve the accessibility of using Q blockchain, and to lower the possibility of error when using plain addresses.

QNS allows users to register a semantic name that points to their address. Also allows them to edit & transfer owned domains.

In order to deploy contracts, create a `.env` file, and define the private key of the account that deploys the contracts. Example of the env file:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=0x1234...1234
```
